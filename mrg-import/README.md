# Machine Readable Glossary Import Tool

## Overview

The **MRG Import Tool** ensures that the scope within which it is run, obtains a local copy of all MRGs that are available in the scopes that are mentioned in the [scopes section](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/tev2/spec-files/saf#scopes) of its SAF. This makes life easy for various tools, e.g., the [MRGT](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/mrgt/) and the [TRRT](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/trrt/), that can now assume that all MRGs that they may need to consult in order to do their job, are readily available. There is more information about 
- the [MRG Import Tool documentation](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/mrg-import/),
- [overview of the TEv2 tools](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/tev2/tev2-overview) of which the MRG Import Tool is a part.

## Installation

| :------------------------- | :---------- | :------: |
| -c, --config \<path>       | Path (including the filename) of the tool's (YAML) [configuration file](#configuration-file) as an absolute or relative path from where the tool is called. This file contains the key-value pairs to be used. Allowed keys (and the associated values) are documented in this table. Command-line arguments override key-value pairs specified in the [configuration file](#configuration-file). This parameter MUST NOT appear in the [configuration file](#configuration-file) itself. |   n   |
| -s, --scopedir \<path>     | Path of the [scope directory](@) from which the tool is called. It MUST contain the [SAF](@) for that [scope](@), which we will refer to as the 'own scope' for the [MRG Import Tool](@). |   Y   |
| -o, --onNotExist \<action> | Specifies the action (i.e., throw, warn, log or ignore) to take in case an [MRG](@) file that was expected to exist, does not exist. Default is `throw`. |  n   |
| -V, --version              | Output the version number of the tool. |   n   |
| -h, --help                 | Display usage and options help text. |   n   |
