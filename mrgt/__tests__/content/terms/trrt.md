# TRRT - TermRef Rendering Tool

The **TRRT** (Terminology Relational-Rendering Tool) is an essential component of the TEv2 toolbox, designed to facilitate the visualization and rendering of terminological artifacts and their interrelationships within a specific terminology. The TRRT takes a [TermRef](@) as input, finds the [MRG](@) and the [entry](mrg-entry@) therin that is being referenced, and replaces that with a [renderable ref](@), thus enabling the term to be rendered with various decorations and other characteristics.
