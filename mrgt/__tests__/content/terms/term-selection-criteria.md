# Term Selection Criteria

**Term Selection Criteria** are criteria that are used within a particular [scope](@) for the selection of [terms](@) that are part of a particular [terminology](@).

Criteria can be formulated for constructing a [terminology](@), by
- selecting [terms](@) [that are to be added](/docs/spec-tools/terminology-construction#syntax-add) to the [terminology-under-construction](@). These [terms](@) can be specified by [curated texts](@) from the [scope](@) itself, or specified within [MRGs](@) that are curated in) other [scopes](@).
- selecting [terms(@)] [that need to be removed](/docs/spec-tools/terminology-construction#syntax-remove) from the [terminology-under-construction](@). 

These criteria are essential for determining which terms should be included in an [MRG](@) (and [HRGs](@)) that are maintained within the [scope](@).

Term selection criteria serve as guidelines for curators and stakeholders to identify and select relevant terms based on predefined rules or filters.

## Examples

1. There are [examples for adding terms ](/docs/spec-tools/terminology-construction#syntax-add) to a [terminology-under-construction](@).
2. There are also [examples for removing terms](/docs/spec-tools/terminology-construction#syntax-remove) from a [terminology-under-construction](@). 

## Notes

- Term selection criteria are essential for ensuring that the terminological assets in a scope are relevant, accurate, and comprehensive.
- Curators use term selection criteria to tailor the terminology to the specific needs and objectives of the community or project.
