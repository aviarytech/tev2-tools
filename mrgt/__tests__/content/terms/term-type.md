# Term Type

A **Term Type** is an [identifier](@) that is used to [identify](@) a particular *kind* of [knowledge artifact](@). Examples include `concept`, `relation`, `pattern` (or `mental-model`).

The ability to specify a [term type](@) as part of a [term](@) mimicks the common practice of disambiguating semantically overloaded [terms](@). With in the context of [TEv2](@), this is currently not used.
