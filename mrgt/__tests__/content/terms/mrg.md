# MRG - Machine Readable Glossary

An **MRG** is a [glossary](@) for a particular (version of a) [terminology](@) that is formatted in YAML, according to the [TEv2 MRG specifications](/docs/spec-files/mrg), to enable automated processing and integration with software systems. Unlike [dictionaries](@), the [terms](@) in an MRG are not ambiguous and have clear and well-defined [meanings](definition@).
